NLog

	- NLog is a logging framework for .NET
	- NLog lets you log messages to a range of data stores (called targets). Everything from the console.

Logging 

	NLog provides a great API for logging messages to one or more targets. 
	If you are already familiar with similar logging frameworks, you'll quickly be up and running logging with NLog.

	Log Levels

		All log messages have a severity called "Level". The following log levels are supported:
			- Fatal
			- Error
			- Warn
			- Info
			- Debug
			- Trace

	Logging Messages

		Logging messages with NLog is easy.
		To log, you need a reference to a Logger from something called LogManager:
			
			Logger log = LogManager.GetCurrentClassLoggr();

		Creating a new logger using the GetCurrentClassLogger method is the easiest way to obain a logger for the current context.
		There are other ways to get a new logger and dependency injection is also available with NLog.
		I may write something about this later if you guys are interested.

		With the Logger instance in hand, you can start logging messages:

		log.Debug("This is a debug message");
		log.Error(new Exception(), "This is an error message");
		log.Fatal("This is a fatal message");
